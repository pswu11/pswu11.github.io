      <description>The Devcon5 is over. It was an amazing and fruitful experience but, what now? Back in July, I jumped into the world of blockchain with only passion, curiosity and very basic knowledge. I was such a newbie. Through Devcon Scholars Program, I have learned more about blockchain but I still feel like - it&amp;rsquo;s NOT ENOUGH.
Even though I have read Bitcoin White Paper, learned about Solidity through ConsenSys Academy, written some articles, finished several bounties, attended many workshops but still - there are too many new things in the ecosystem everyday and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I could ever catch up.</description>
