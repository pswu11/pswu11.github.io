      <description>Note: This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t intend to be investment advice, so I intentionally avoid mentioning specific staking providers. If you find any information unclear/incorrect, feel free to let me know.
We talked about staking during the recent SheFi session. And I noticed it is among the most confusing topics for many others, including myself. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to grasp the concept of why staking is necessary for security and decentralization, and why it might be an interesting way to invest.</description>

      <description>I am accepted! In the last two months I have thought of various of topics I could potentially use for my very first article on Medium. Well, I never expected it would be about Devcon5. But hey, this is real. On Jul. 17, 2019, I woke up in my bed seeing an email with the title [Devcon 5], which drew my attention immediately. Long story short, I received a full scholarship for attending Devcon5!</description>
