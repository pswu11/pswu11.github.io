      <description>I am accepted! In the last two months I have thought of various of topics I could potentially use for my very first article on Medium. Well, I never expected it would be about Devcon5. But hey, this is real. On Jul. 17, 2019, I woke up in my bed seeing an email with the title [Devcon 5], which drew my attention immediately. Long story short, I received a full scholarship for attending Devcon5!</description>
