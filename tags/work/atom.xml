      <description>Since I started working in 2010, I&amp;rsquo;ve had bad times, but I was luckily never laid off.
Thanks to Covid-19, the ongoing war, all the tech companies out there that constantly tell us how bad our economy is, and perhaps some unknown reasons (if I could ever know), I lost my job - for the first time in my life.
To be fair, I&amp;rsquo;ve imagined this could happen when I chose a career at early-stage startups.</description>
