# General FAQ

## What are your key technologies and IPs?

C&H has patents respectively for the hot water cooling technology, the data center container as well as software-defined energy optimization. Further information could be provided if demanded.

## How does water-cooling work?

The traditional cooling for data center is based on air, using fans or air-conditioners. However, water has better cooling efficiency. The water-cooling we use at Cloud&Heat is called direct hot water cooling: each server is equipped with pipes that go directly to the points where the heat is generated, mainly **mainboard chipset, CPU, RAM, and GPU**. In the server rack, there are pumping boxes and hydraulics are used to maintain a closed water circuit.

## What are your competitive advantages against other water-cooling providers?

**Direct-on-chip hot water cooling vs. Immersion cooling**

* Labels fall off in oil
* Plastic dissolve in oil
* It's harder to seal up oil \(Water is more sealable\)
* Handling drips during the maintenance is more problematic
* ~~schlechtere volumetrische Wärmekapazität \(To be checked\)~~
* ~~Dafür aber echte 100% Flüssigkühlung \(To be checked\)~~

**What is C&H USP?**

We use direct hot water cooling so that we have the waste heat at a temperature level of 60°C. This enables us to offer waste heat recovery or to dissipate the heat to the environment by free cooling at most locations worldwide without a refrigeration machine.  
In addition, we offer a complete package from infrastructure planning, construction, to operations.This includes the conversion of air-cooled systems to water cooling, a secure cloud operating system, SecuStack, and of course, a monitoring/operations for the data centers.  
Ultimately, it is the total package of energy-efficient hardware and secure cloud operating system.
